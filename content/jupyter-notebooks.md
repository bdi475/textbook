# Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks are an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. They are widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing for data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, and machine learning.

## Why Use Jupyter Notebooks?

- **Interactive Coding**: You can write and execute code in small chunks (cells), making it easier to test and debug.
- **Rich Media**: You can include images, videos, and interactive visualizations alongside your code.
- **Documentation**: You can use Markdown to create well-documented notebooks that explain your code and findings.
- **Reproducibility**: Notebooks can be shared and rerun by others, ensuring that your analyses can be reproduced.
- **Integration**: Jupyter supports many programming languages, including Python, R, and Julia.

## Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks

There are multiple ways to run Jupyter Notebooks:

1. **JupyterLab Desktop App**: (recommended for this course): JupyterLab is the next-generation user interface for Jupyter Notebooks. It provides a more flexible and powerful environment for working with notebooks, code, and data. You can download the JupyterLab desktop app from [here](https://jupyter.org/install).
2. **Anaconda Distribution (Local Installation via Anaconda)**: Anaconda is a popular distribution of Python and R for scientific computing and data science. It comes with Jupyter Notebooks pre-installed. You can download Anaconda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

3. **JupyterLab (Local Installation via `pip`)**: JupyterLab is the next-generation user interface for Jupyter Notebooks. It provides a more flexible and powerful environment for working with notebooks, code, and data. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install jupyterlab
   ```

   Then, you can start JupyterLab by running:

   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

4. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: VS Code is a popular code editor that supports Jupyter Notebooks through an extension. You can install the "Jupyter" extension from the VS Code marketplace. More information can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
5. **Google Colab**: Google Colab is a free cloud-based service that allows you to run Jupyter Notebooks without any local installation. You can access it at [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com/). It provides free access to GPUs and TPUs, making it suitable for machine learning tasks. **However, this may be an inconvenient option for this course, as you will need to upload and download files frequently.**
