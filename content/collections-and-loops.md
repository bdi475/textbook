# Collections and Loops

Collections are data structures that can hold multiple items, while loops are used to iterate over these collections. In this section, we will explore lists and dictionaries as examples of collections, and we will learn how to use loops to work with them.

## Lists

Lists are a fundamental data structure in Python, allowing you to store multiple items in a single variable. Loops are used to iterate over these items, enabling you to perform operations on each element in the list.

### Creating Lists

You can create a list by placing items inside square brackets `[]`, separated by commas. Lists can contain items of different data types, including numbers, strings, and even other lists.

```python
# Creating a list of integers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Creating a list of strings
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Creating a mixed list
mixed = [1, "hello", 3.14, True]

# Creating a nested list
nested = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
```

### Accessing List Elements

```python
# Accessing elements by index
first_number = numbers[0]   # 1
second_fruit = fruits[1]    # "banana"
third_item = mixed[2]       # 3.14
first_sublist = nested[0]   # [1, 2]

# Accessing the last element
last_fruit = fruits[-1]     # "cherry"

# Slicing a list
sublist = numbers[1:4]      # [2, 3, 4]
```

### Modifying Lists

```python
numbers[0] = 10         # numbers is now [10, 2, 3, 4, 5]
fruits.append("date")   # fruits is now ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
mixed.remove(3.14)      # mixed is now [1, "hello", True]
nested[1][0] = 30       # nested is now [[1, 2], [30, 4], [5, 6]]
```

### Slicing Lists

You can extract a portion of a list using slicing. Slicing allows you to create a new list that contains a subset of the elements from the original list.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sublist = numbers[1:4]      # [2, 3, 4]
```

Note that the starting index is inclusive, while the ending index is exclusive.

### Tuples

Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation. Tuples are defined using parentheses `()`.

```python
# Creating a tuple
coordinates = (10, 20)

x = coordinates[0]
y = coordinates[1]

print(f"x: {x}, y: {y}")
```

The output of the above code will be:

```
x: 10, y: 20
```

Tuples are often used to represent fixed collections of items, such as coordinates or RGB color values.

## Loops

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. In Python, there are two main types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops.

### For Loops

You can use `for` loops to iterate over the elements of a list. This allows you to perform operations on each item in the list.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

```

Here's the output of the above code:

```
# Output:
apple
banana
cherry
```

You can also use loops to perform operations on each element in a list. For example, you can multiply each number in a list by 2.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for number in numbers:
    print(number * 2)
```

Here's the output of the above code:

```
# Output:
2
4
6
8
10
```

### While Loops

A `while` loop continues to execute as long as a specified condition is `True`. Be careful to ensure that the condition will eventually become `False`, or you may create an infinite loop.

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1  # Increment count to avoid infinite loop
```

Here's the output of the above code:

```
# Output:
0
1
2
3
4
```

:::{caution} Infinite Loops
An infinite loop occurs when the loop's condition never becomes `False`. This can cause your program to run indefinitely, which may lead to crashes or unresponsiveness. Always ensure that the loop's condition will eventually be met by modifying variables within the loop.
:::

### Looping with `range()`

The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers, which is often used in `for` loops to iterate a specific number of times.

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

Here's the output of the above code:

```
# Output:
0
1
2
3
4
```

:::{tip} What is `i` in the loop?
The `i` variable in the `for` loop acts as a loop counter that takes on each value in the sequence generated by `range(5)`, which are the numbers 0 through 4. You can name this variable anything you like; it's just a placeholder for the current value in the iteration.

`i` is commonly used as a convention, but you could use other names like `index`, `num`, or `item` depending on the context of your loop. The name of the variable does not affect the functionality of the loop; it simply represents the current item in the iteration. It is a temporary variable that exists only within the scope of the loop.
:::

### Nested Loops

You can also use nested loops, which are loops inside other loops. This is useful for working with multi-dimensional lists.

```python
nested = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]

for sublist in nested:
    for item in sublist:
        print(item)
```

Here's the output of the above code:

```
# Output:
1
2
3
4
5
6
```

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries are another important collection type in Python. They store data in key-value pairs, allowing you to quickly retrieve values based on their associated keys.

:::{tip} Why are they called dictionaries?
Dictionaries are named after real-world dictionaries, where you look up a word (the key) to find its definition (the value). Similarly, in a Python dictionary, you use a key to access its corresponding value.
:::

### Creating Dictionaries

You can create a dictionary by placing key-value pairs inside curly braces `{}`, separated by commas. Each key is separated from its value by a colon `:`.

```python
person = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "Champaign"
}
```

### Accessing Dictionary Values

To access a value in a dictionary, you use its key inside square brackets `[]`.

```python
name = person["name"]  # "John"
age = person["age"]    # 30
city = person["city"]  # "Champaign"

print(name) # Output: John
print(age)  # Output: 30
print(city) # Output: Champaign
```

### Modifying Dictionaries

You can add new key-value pairs or update existing ones by assigning a value to a key.

```python
person["email"] = "john@example.com"  # Add new key-value pair
person["age"] = 31                    # Update existing value
```

### Nested Dictionaries

Dictionaries can also contain other dictionaries, allowing you to create complex data structures.

```python
people = {
    "person1": {
        "name": "John",
        "age": 30
    },
    "person2": {
        "name": "Jane",
        "age": 25
    }
}
```

### Looping Through Dictionaries

You can use a `for` loop to iterate over the keys in a dictionary. You can then use these keys to access the corresponding values.

```python
for person_key in people:
    person = people[person_key]
    print(f"{person['name']} is {person['age']} years old.")
```

Here's the output of the above code:

```
# Output:
John is 30 years old.
Jane is 25 years old.
```

You can also loop through both keys and values using the `.items()` method.

```python
for person_key, person in people.items():
    print(f"{person_key}: {person['name']} is {person['age']} years old.")
```

Here's the output of the above code:

```
# Output:
person1: John is 30 years old.
person2: Jane is 25 years old.
```

## Mixing Collections and Loops

You can combine lists and dictionaries to create more complex data structures. For example, you can have a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a person.

```python
people = [
    {
        "name": "John",
        "age": 30
    },
    {
        "name": "Jane",
        "age": 25
    }
]

for person in people:
    print(f"{person['name']} is {person['age']} years old.")
```

Here's the output of the above code:

```
# Output:
John is 30 years old.
Jane is 25 years old.
```

You can also have a dictionary of lists, where each key represents a category and the value is a list of items in that category.

```python
fruits = {
    "citrus": ["orange", "lemon", "lime"],
    "berries": ["strawberry", "blueberry", "raspberry"]
}

for category, fruit_list in fruits.items():
    print(f"{category.capitalize()}:")
    for fruit in fruit_list:
        print(f" - {fruit}")
```

Here's the output of the above code:

```
# Output:
Citrus:
 - orange
 - lemon
 - lime
Berries:
 - strawberry
 - blueberry
 - raspberry
```
