# Collections and Loops

Collections are data structures that can hold multiple items, while loops are used to iterate over these collections. In this section, we will explore lists and dictionaries as examples of collections, and we will learn how to use loops to work with them.

## 📝 Lists

Lists are a fundamental data structure in Python, allowing you to store multiple items in a single variable. Loops are used to iterate over these items, enabling you to perform operations on each element in the list.

---

### 🛠️ List Operations

#### 🆕 Creating Lists

You can create a list by placing items inside square brackets `[]`, separated by commas. Lists can contain items of different data types, including numbers, strings, and even other lists.

```python
# Creating a list of integers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Creating a list of strings
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Creating a mixed list
mixed = [1, "hello", 3.14, True]

# Creating a nested list
nested = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
```

You can check the type of a list using the `type()` function:

```python
print(type([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: <class 'list'>
```

---

#### 📚 Accessing List Elements

```python
# Accessing elements by index
first_number = numbers[0]   # 1
second_fruit = fruits[1]    # "banana"
third_item = mixed[2]       # 3.14
first_sublist = nested[0]   # [1, 2]

# Accessing the last element
last_fruit = fruits[-1]     # "cherry"

# Slicing a list
sublist = numbers[1:4]      # [2, 3, 4]
```

---

#### ✏️ Modifying Lists

```python
numbers[0] = 10         # numbers is now [10, 2, 3, 4, 5]
fruits.append("date")   # fruits is now ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
mixed.remove(3.14)      # mixed is now [1, "hello", True]
nested[1][0] = 30       # nested is now [[1, 2], [30, 4], [5, 6]]
```

---

#### ✂️ Slicing Lists

You can extract a portion of a list using slicing. Slicing allows you to create a new list that contains a subset of the elements from the original list.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sublist = numbers[1:4]      # [2, 3, 4]
```

Note that the starting index is inclusive, while the ending index is exclusive.

---

#### 📏 Length of a List

You can find out how many items are in a list using the `len()` function.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
length = len(fruits)  # 3
```

---

### 🔒 Tuples

Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation. Tuples are defined using parentheses `()`.

```python
# Creating a tuple
coordinates = (10, 20)

x = coordinates[0]
y = coordinates[1]

print(f"x: {x}, y: {y}")
```

The output of the above code will be:

```
x: 10, y: 20
```

You can check the type of a tuple using the `type()` function:

```python
print(type((1, 2, 3)))  # Output: <class 'tuple'>
```

Tuples are often used to represent fixed collections of items, such as coordinates or RGB color values.

In this course, we will primarily use lists, but it's important to be aware of tuples as they are commonly used in Python programming.

---

## 🔁 Loops

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. In Python, there are two main types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops.

---

### ➡️ For Loops

You can use `for` loops to iterate over the elements of a list. This allows you to perform operations on each item in the list.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

```

Here's the output of the above code:

```
# Output:
apple
banana
cherry
```

You can also use loops to perform operations on each element in a list. For example, you can multiply each number in a list by 2.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for i in numbers:
    print(i * 2)
```

Here's the output of the above code:

```
# Output:
2
4
6
8
10
```

:::{tip} What is `i` in the loop?
The `i` variable in the `for` loop acts as a loop counter that takes on each value in the sequence generated by `range(5)`, which are the numbers 0 through 4. You can name this variable anything you like; it's just a placeholder for the current value in the iteration.

`i` is commonly used as a convention, but you could use other names like `index`, `num`, or `item` depending on the context of your loop. The name of the variable does not affect the functionality of the loop; it simply represents the current item in the iteration. It is a temporary variable that exists only within the scope of the loop.

#### 🛞 For Loop Examples

**🎯 Example: Counting Items in a List**

```{code} python
:label: count-items-in-a-list
:caption: Counting Items in a List
:linenos:
:emphasize-lines: 12-14

fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango", "Orange",
          "Apple", "Grapes", "Mango", "Apple",
          "Banana", "Apple", "Orange", "Apple",
          "Mango", "Peach", "Apple", "Apple",
          "Banana", "Apple", "Apple", "Mango",
          "Orange", "Apple", "Apple", "Banana",
          "Apple", "Apple", "Grapes", "Apple",
          "Peach", "Apple"]
num_apple = 0

# Counting the number of "Apple" in the list
for fruit in fruits:
    if fruit == "Apple":
        num_apple += 1

print(f"You have {num_apple} apples.") # Output: You have 15 apples.
```

In @count-items-in-a-list code above, we iterate through the list of fruits and increment the `num_apple` counter each time we encounter "Apple". Finally, we print the total count of apples.

The `+=` operator is a shorthand for incrementing a variable by a certain value. For example, `num_apple += 1` is equivalent to `num_apple = num_apple + 1`. Each time we find "Apple" in the list, we increase the count by 1 using this shorthand increment operator.

---

**🎯 Example: Summing Values in a List**

```{code} python
:label: sum-values-in-a-list
:caption: Summing Values in a List
:linenos:
:emphasize-lines: 5-6

hours_worked = [8, 7, 9, 6, 8]
total_hours = 0

# YOUR CODE BEGINS
for v in hours_worked:
    total_hours += v
# YOUR CODE ENDS

print(f"Total hours worked: {total_hours}") # Output: Total hours worked: 38
```

In the @sum-values-in-a-list code above, we iterate through the list of hours worked and add each value to the `total_hours` variable. Finally, we print the total hours worked.

---

**🎯 Example: Summing Odd Numbers**

```{code} python
:label: sum-odd-numbers-in-a-list
:caption: Summing Odd Numbers in a List
:linenos:
:emphasize-lines: 5-7

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
odd_sum = 0

# YOUR CODE BEGINS
for num in nums:
    if num % 2 != 0:
        odd_sum += num
# YOUR CODE ENDS

print(f"Sum of odd numbers: {odd_sum}") # Output: Sum of odd numbers: 16
```

In the @sum-odd-numbers-in-a-list code above, we iterate through the list of numbers and check if each number is odd. If it is, we add it to the `odd_sum` variable. Finally, we print the total sum of odd numbers.

---

**🎯 Example: Average of Even Numbers and Odd Numbers**

```{code} python
:label: average-of-even-and-odd-numbers-in-a-list
:caption: Calculate Average of Even Numbers and Odd Numbers in a List
:linenos:
:emphasize-lines: 3-17

nums = [15, 8, 7, 5, 15, 72, -20, -66, 9, -4, -11, 21, 19]

even_sum = 0
even_count = 0
odd_sum = 0
odd_count = 0

for n in nums:
    if n % 2 == 0:
        even_sum += n
        even_count += 1
    else:
        odd_sum += n
        odd_count += 1

even_avg = even_sum / even_count
odd_avg = odd_sum / odd_count

print(f'Average of even numbers is {even_avg}')
print(f'Average of odd numbers is {odd_avg}')

# Output:
# Average of even numbers is -2.0
# Average of odd numbers is 10.0
```

In the @average-of-even-and-odd-numbers-in-a-list code above, we iterate through the list of numbers and separate them into even and odd categories. We maintain separate sums and counts for both even and odd numbers. After the loop, we calculate the average for each category by dividing the sum by the count. Finally, we print the averages of even and odd numbers.

---

#### 🔢 Looping with `range()`

The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers, which is often used in `for` loops to iterate a specific number of times.

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

Here's the output of the above code:

```
# Output:
0
1
2
3
4
```

---

#### ♻️ Nested Loops

You can also use nested loops, which are loops inside other loops. This is useful for working with multi-dimensional lists.

```python
nested = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]

for sublist in nested:
    for item in sublist:
        print(item)
```

Here's the output of the above code:

```
# Output:
1
2
3
4
5
6
```

---

### 🔄 While Loops

A `while` loop continues to execute as long as a specified condition is `True`. Be careful to ensure that the condition will eventually become `False`, or you may create an infinite loop.

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1  # Increment count to avoid infinite loop
```

Here's the output of the above code:

```
# Output:
0
1
2
3
4
```

:::{caution} Infinite Loops
An infinite loop occurs when the loop's condition never becomes `False`. This can cause your program to run indefinitely, which may lead to crashes or unresponsiveness. Always ensure that the loop's condition will eventually be met by modifying variables within the loop.

## 📖 Dictionaries

Dictionaries are another important collection type in Python. They store data in key-value pairs, allowing you to quickly retrieve values based on their associated keys.

:::{tip} Why are they called dictionaries?
Dictionaries are named after real-world dictionaries, where you look up a word (the key) to find its definition (the value). Similarly, in a Python dictionary, you use a key to access its corresponding value.
:::

---

### 🛠️ Dictionary Operations

#### 🆕 Creating Dictionaries

You can create a dictionary by placing key-value pairs inside curly braces `{}`, separated by commas. Each key is separated from its value by a colon `:`.

```python
person = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "Champaign"
}
```

You can check the type of a dictionary using the `type()` function:

```python
print(type({"key": "value"}))  # Output: <class 'dict'>
```

#### 🎯 Accessing Dictionary Values

To access a value in a dictionary, you use its key inside square brackets `[]`.

```python
name = person["name"]  # "John"
age = person["age"]    # 30
city = person["city"]  # "Champaign"

print(name) # Output: John
print(age)  # Output: 30
print(city) # Output: Champaign
```

#### ✏️ Modifying Dictionaries

You can add new key-value pairs or update existing ones by assigning a value to a key.

```python
person["email"] = "john@example.com"  # Add new key-value pair
person["age"] = 31                    # Update existing value
```

---

### 🧩 Nested Dictionaries

Dictionaries can also contain other dictionaries, allowing you to create complex data structures.

```python
people = {
    "person1": {
        "name": "John",
        "age": 30
    },
    "person2": {
        "name": "Jane",
        "age": 25
    }
}
```

---

### 🔎 Looping Through Dictionaries

You can use a `for` loop to iterate over the keys in a dictionary. You can then use these keys to access the corresponding values.

```python
for person_key in people:
    person = people[person_key]
    print(f"{person['name']} is {person['age']} years old.")
```

Here's the output of the above code:

```
# Output:
John is 30 years old.
Jane is 25 years old.
```

You can also loop through both keys and values using the `.items()` method.

```python
for person_key, person in people.items():
    print(f"{person_key}: {person['name']} is {person['age']} years old.")
```

Here's the output of the above code:

```
# Output:
person1: John is 30 years old.
person2: Jane is 25 years old.
```

---

## 🥣 Mixing Collections and Loops

You can combine lists and dictionaries to create more complex data structures. For example, you can have a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a person.

```python
people = [
    {
        "name": "John",
        "age": 30
    },
    {
        "name": "Jane",
        "age": 25
    }
]

for person in people:
    print(f"{person['name']} is {person['age']} years old.")
```

Here's the output of the above code:

```
# Output:
John is 30 years old.
Jane is 25 years old.
```

You can also have a dictionary of lists, where each key represents a category and the value is a list of items in that category.

```python
fruits = {
    "citrus": ["orange", "lemon", "lime"],
    "berries": ["strawberry", "blueberry", "raspberry"]
}

for category, fruit_list in fruits.items():
    print(f"{category.capitalize()}:")
    for fruit in fruit_list:
        print(f" - {fruit}")
```

Here's the output of the above code:

```
# Output:
Citrus:
 - orange
 - lemon
 - lime
Berries:
 - strawberry
 - blueberry
 - raspberry
```

**🎯 Example: Calculating Total Salary of Engineering Employees**

```{code} python
:label: total-salary-of-engineering-employees-in-a-list-of-dictionaries
:caption: Calculate Total Salary of Engineering Employees
:linenos:
:emphasize-lines: 29-33

employees = [
    {
        "name": "Alice",
        "department": "Engineering",
        "salary": 95000
    },
    {
        "name": "Bob",
        "department": "Marketing",
        "salary": 72000
    },
    {
        "name": "Charlie",
        "department": "Engineering",
        "salary": 105000
    },
    {
        "name": "Diana",
        "department": "HR",
        "salary": 68000
    },
    {
        "name": "Ethan",
        "department": "Engineering",
        "salary": 99000
    }
]

engineering_total_salary = 0

for e in employees:
    if e["department"] == "Engineering":
        engineering_total_salary += e["salary"]

print(f"Engineering employees' total salary is {engineering_total_salary}!") # Output: Engineering employees' total salary is 299000!
```

In the @total-salary-of-engineering-employees-in-a-list-of-dictionaries code above, we iterate through the list of employees and check if each employee belongs to the "Engineering" department. If they do, we add their salary to the `engineering_total_salary` variable. Finally, we print the total salary of all engineering employees.

The `if` statement inside the loop allows us to filter the employees based on their department, ensuring that we only sum the salaries of those in the "Engineering" department. It is indented to be part of the loop, meaning it is executed for each employee in the list. It checks the condition for each employee and only adds their salary to the total if they meet the criteria.
